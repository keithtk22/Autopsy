# Autopsy Investigation

## Objective

I am tasked to investigate if there was user activity while the user was away between 12:05 PM to 12:45 PM on the 19th of November 2022. If there are, figure out what files were accessed and exfiltrated externally.
You'll be accessing a live system, but use the disk image already exported to the C:\Users\THM-RFedora\Desktop\kape-results\C directory for your investigation.
